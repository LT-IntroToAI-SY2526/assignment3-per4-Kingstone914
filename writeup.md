# Assignment 3 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment completes our movie chatbot system by implementing action functions that query our movie database and building a natural language interface. You implemented functions to search for movies by year, director, and actors, as well as the core search system that matches user queries to appropriate database operations. This builds directly on the pattern matching work from Assignment 2 to create a functional conversational AI system.

## What to complete
1. Complete all action functions in `a3.py` (title_by_year, title_by_year_range, etc.)
2. Implement the `search_pa_list` function to handle pattern matching and responses  
3. Add at least one new movie to the database with proper formatting
4. Create a new pattern/action pair and add it to the pa_list
5. Ensure all provided assert statements pass
6. Complete the reflection questions below
7. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions

1. What are some key programming concepts or techniques that you learned while completing this assignment? Some key concepts I learned while completing this assignment was match functions, lists, and strings.I'm still struggling a little bit of understanding these concepts but I'm slowly understanding how they work. I also am slowly learning asserts since I never really added asserts in the previous assignments.



2. How does the overall movie chatbot system work? Explain the flow from when a user types a query to when they receive an answer. I think the movie chatbot works by typing a set amount of information then you use functions like title_by_year to find certain things like titles from oldest to newest. If I'm going to be honest, I don't really understand querys but I'm slowly undertanding the concept of a query to when they recieve an answer.



3. What are some real-world applications where this type of pattern-matching chatbot system could be useful? How might you extend or improve this system for practical use? You can use this pattern-matching chatbot as a checklist for homework. You could put the dates and what has to be done and use the chatbot to remind you on what has to be done. Another example could be nba players and when they were drafted. Maybe a NBA commentater needs to know when certain players were drafted so a chatbot might be useful. You could possibly make the chatbot output extra informtion like all the stats of an NBA player every game. It could keeps track of a player's feild goal maybe.
